<P>This section notes constraints that we've come across on
various systems.  This is not meant to be a complete list of all
possible problems.

<H4>SMTSOCK and the select() call</H4>

<P>SMTSOCK uses the select() call to wait for socket events.  On
UNIX systems, select() returns when the process receives a signal.
We use this fact to implement the process timer, SMTTIME, in an
application that may also be doing socket i/o.

<P>Under Windows 95, however, the select() call does not unblock
when a signal is sent.  The winsock call WSACancelBlockingCall()
is meant to unblock the select() call.  This does not work under
Windows 95, at least.  (WSAIsBlocking() always reports FALSE.)

<P>The consequence of this is that the timeout specified in the
select() call makes a difference to the way that the timer work.
If we use a 1-second timeout, for instance, we find that timer
events are also limited to a resolution of 1 second.  This makes
it difficult to use timer events for real-time work in socket
based applications.

<P>This appears to be a bug in the Windows 95 winsock.dll; it
may also affect Windows NT.

<P>Our solution is to use WSACancelBlockingCall() in any case,
should the winsock.dll support it correctly.  Secondly, under
Windows, we reduce the select() timeout from 1 second to 1/5th
of a second.  On other systems - UNIX, OS/2 - we use 1 second,
so that the application uses minimal system resources.
