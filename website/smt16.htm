<H2><A NAME="TOC53">The Unattended Process Monitor (UPM) Tool</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="TOC54">Overview</A></H3>

<P>The UPM tool is a small application developed with SMT, and
included as an example.  The UPM tool was developed on UNIX and may
not be very useful on other systems.

<P>The UPM tool allows you to manage 'unattended' processes, which
may handle input/output on some devices, typically terminals.  The
UPM tool lets you start and stop such processes, manually or using
a timer.

<H3><A NAME="TOC55">Technical Details</A></H3>

<P>The UPM tool consists of four programs:
<OL>
<LI><TT>upmd</TT> is a server program that runs permanently.
<LI><TT>upmc</TT> is a client program that provides a command-level
interface.
<LI><TT>smtupmd</TT> is an agent that handles the UPM server
protocol.  The <TT>upmd</TT> program is basically a wrapper around
this agent.
<LI><TT>smtupmc</TT> is an agent that handles the UPM client
protocol.  The <TT>upmc</TT> program is basically a wrapper around
this agent.
</OL>

<P>The main UPM configuration file is called "upm.ini".  This is
a typical "upm.ini" file:
</PRE>[Setup]
    logfile=upmd.log
[Tasks]
    name=task1
    name=task2
</PRE>

<P>The [Tasks] section defines each of the UPM tasks.  Each task
has a config file to define task-specific values. The config file
for "task1" is called "TASK1.ini". For example:
<PRE>#   Configuration for Task 1
[Setup]
    stdin=/dev/pts/1
    stdout=/dev/pts/1
    stderr=/dev/pts/1
[Environment]
    DATABASE=test
    PRINTER=tcp://localhost:1000
[Run]
    idle=banner IDLE
    startup=run BBORNE.gnt
    cancel=cleanup
</PRE>

<P>The [Setup] section defines the input/output devices for the
task.  The [Environment] section defines a list of variables for
the task.  The [Run] section defines the idle command and the
startup command.  These commands must be executable files (scripts
or programs) with optional arguments.  Redirection or multiple
commands are not permitted.

<P>Each task also has an optional TIMES file.  The times file for
task1 is called "TASK1.tim", and looks something like this:
<PRE>#  This file specifies the times for Task1

mon 8-12 12:30-20
tue 8-12 12:30-20
wed 8-12 12:30-20
thu 8-12 13:05-13:06  13:08:13-10
fri 8-12 12:30-20
12/25 off
1/1 off
</PRE>

<P>Each line (except blank lines and comments) defines some times
for a day.  The first word on the line is the <EM>day</EM>, the
remaining words are one or more time <EM>specifications</EM>.  A
day can be:
<UL>
<LI>A day name, Mon-Sun.
<LI>A date, MM/DD or YY/MM/DD or YYYY/MM/DD.  If you use YY/MM/DD,
the century is assumed to be 20 for years higher than 50.
</UL>
A time specification can be:
<UL>
<LI>'off', meaning clear all times for that day.
<LI>hh:mm-hh:mm, meaning activate for that time range, inclusive.
</UL>

<P>If no TIMES file is provided, you can (or rather, must) start
and stop the tasks manually.

<H3><A NAME="TOC56">Using The UPM Tool</A></H3>

<OL>
<LI>Define the upm.ini and task .ini files correctly.  Make sure
that the devices exist and are writable.
<LI>For testing, run the <TT>upmd</TT> program in a shell window.
For real life use, place into the system startup procedure
(<TT>inittab</TT> on a UNIX system).  You can run <TT>upmd</TT> in
the background like this (assuming a UNIX system):

<PRE>nohup upmd&
</PRE>

<P>Run the command <TT>upmc</TT> to start the BORMAN client.  The
<TT>upmc<TT> program acts as a 'front-end' for the upmd daemon.
Since the daemon runs as a process in the background, it cannot
read commands from the keyboard itself.

<P>When you run <TT>upmc<TT> you get a message like this:
<PRE>upmc> 100- Connecting to UPM daemon...
upmc> 102- Connected to UPM daemon version 1.0
upmc></PRE>

<P>You can give various commands at the prompt.  This is what the
'help' command shows:
<PRE>upmc> help
Commands and arguments can be in any case.  Commands are:
LIST                 - list all known tasks
START [task | ALL]   - start specified task (default all)
STOP [task | ALL]    - stop specified task (default all)
STATUS [task | ALL]  - show status for specified task (default all)
HALT                 - halt UPM daemon
EXIT                 - end this UPM client session
QUIT                 - end this UPM client session
HELP                 - show this information
VERSION              - show UPM client version
</PRE>

<P>If you run <TT>upmc<TT> when the <TT>upmd<TT> daemon is not
running, you get this:
<PRE>upmc> 100- Connecting to UPM daemon...
upmc> 301- UPD daemon connection failed: Connection refused
</PRE>

<P>You can also run <TT>upmc<TT> to execute a command directly:
<PRE>$ upmc start all
</PRE>
Which is the same as typing this:
<PRE>$ upmc start
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="TOC57">UPM Trouble Shooting</A></H3>

<P>These are some possible errors:
<UL>
<LI>The device you specified in the task .ini file is not
accessible to the upm daemon.  You will get an error message in the
daemon log file, or in the shell window where you ran
<TT>upmd</TT>.
<LI>The commands you specified in the task .ini file are not found
or not accessible.  You will get an error message in the daemon log
file, or in the shell window where you ran <TT>upmd<TT>.
</UL>
